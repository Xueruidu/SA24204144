\title{Plot Network Graph without Self-Loops}
\usage{
graph_plot(matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A symmetric weighted adjacency matrix with no self-loops.}
}
\value{
A network plot showing the relationships between nodes.
}
\description{
This function plots a network graph from an adjacency matrix, 
             ensuring that the matrix is square, symmetric, and free of self-loops.
             It uses edge weights to color the edges and adjusts their thickness.

\examples{
\dontrun{
    # Generate a random 10x10 correlation matrix
    set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
    random_data <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10) # Random data with 10 variables
    corr_matrix <- cor(random_data) # Compute correlation matrix
    
    # Ensure the diagonal elements are 0 for a graph adjacency matrix
    adj_matrix <- corr_matrix
    
    # Visualize the graph using graph_plot
    graph_plot(adj_matrix)
